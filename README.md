# Auto_Encoder
Machine Learning Tool to auto generate an image from other image.

This tool is made to demonstrate the application of machine learning in some real world examples 
with CIFAR-10 datasets.
In this project, auto encoder has been used to re-construct an image from an input image with same 
dimensions.
This tool uses the auto encoder to do so, where first the input image will be encoded to get the 
important feature, and then it will be decoded again to extract the real image.
